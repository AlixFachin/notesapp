# Description
This project was realized during my time at Code Chrysalis coding bootcamp in Tokyo.
This is the outcome of a one-day sprint where we had to implement and deploy a basic full-stack note-taking app.

# Principle
The goal was to build a full-stack notes app with the following functionalities:
* Each note has a summary and a main message
* Visualisation of all the notes summaries and zoom in on the main note
* Creation of a new note with default values
* Deletion of a note
* Update of a note
* The application has to be somewhat responsive

# Deployment
You can see a deployed version of the app at the following address:
[Blu Note app](https://blu-note-prod.herokuapp.com)

# Installation for local development
Feel free to fork and clone the repo.
This repo is using `npm` so you should be OK with running `npm install` after having cloned the repo on your machine.

# Stack
* Using React for the front-end, create_react_app for the initial scaffolding
* Using REST API via Axios on the client side and Express on the server side
* Using KNEX.js for the database interactions
* Using PostgresSQL for database
* Using Heroku for deployment
